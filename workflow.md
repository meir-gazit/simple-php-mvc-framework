To create a new screen you need to create 3 files:
  1. In the App/Views folder, create a new folder with the name of the screen and a file named index.php in it.
  2. In the App/Controllers folder, create a new file with the name of the screen.
  3. In the App/Modelss folder, create a new file with the name of the screen.

Now we have m.v.c files to work with, keep in mind that the standart is to call the controller files as singular and the model files as plural.

After creating the files and add functuality we need to add routing to them, that will be added to the main app entrance file which is index.php in the public folder.
